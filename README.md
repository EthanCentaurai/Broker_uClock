## The Quick Intro

Broker uClock is the spiritual successor to my old [FuBar uClock](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info10621), which itself was a re-write of [FuBar ClockFu](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4605), re-written from the ground up using Ace-3.0 and LibDataBroker-1.1.

* Shows realm time, local time, or UTC time in the data feed (or all three!).
* Shows today's date aswell as realm time, local time, and UTC time in the tooltip.
* Toggles the in-game Time Manager (stop watch, alarm clock, etc.) if clicked.
* Toggles GroupCalendar (if installed) or the in-game calendar if shift-clicked.

As uClock is written to utilise LibDataBroker, you must also install a "broker display" addon in order for this addon to work.

## Configuration

Options can be found in the config window accessed by right-clicking the plugin.

* Choose to have a chime play at the start of a new hour. The sound file can be configured or turned off completely.
* Choose which time formats you want shown in the data feed, and what order they appear in.
* Choose whether to show seconds or hide them.
* Choose whether to have the time shown in 12-hour or 24-hour format.
